## Projects

### Simple Search Engine
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/simple-search-engine)  
A Java-based search engine that indexes and ranks books using an inverted index.  
Demonstrates object-oriented design, data structures, and search algorithm implementation.

### Java Cipher Suite
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/java-cipher-suite)  
A Java project implementing a variety of classical ciphers, including **Caesar (key and shift variants), substitution ciphers, and a MultiCipher** that combines different encoding methods. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, inheritance, and abstract classes in Java while practicing encryption and decryption algorithms.

### Connect Four
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/connect-four)  
Java implementation of a Connect Four strategy game built on an abstract strategy game framework. Demonstrates object-oriented design, abstract classes, and game logic including move validation, win/tie detection, and console-based gameplay.
