# Amber Li — Portfolio
Welcome! This repository highlights my academic and personal software projects, including Java coursework and internship coding samples.

## About Me
Computer science student with interests in software development, data structures, and AI-assisted tooling. Building skills through coursework, internships, and personal projects.

## Projects

### Simple Search Engine
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/simple-search-engine)  
A Java-based search engine that indexes and ranks books using an inverted index.  
Demonstrates object-oriented design, data structures, and search algorithm implementation.

### Java Cipher Suite
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/java-cipher-suite)  
A Java project implementing a variety of classical ciphers, including Caesar (key and shift variants), substitution ciphers, and a MultiCipher that combines different encoding methods. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, inheritance, and abstract classes in Java while practicing encryption and decryption algorithms.

### Connect Four
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/connect-four)  
Java implementation of a Connect Four strategy game built on an abstract strategy game framework. Demonstrates object-oriented design, abstract classes, and game logic including move validation, win/tie detection, and console-based gameplay.

### Mini-Git
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/mini-git)  
Developed a simplified Git-like version control system in Java, supporting commits, history tracking, dropping commits, and repository synchronization. Practiced object-oriented design, linked data structures, and console-based application development.

### Mondrian Art
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/mondrian-art)  
Java-based generative art program inspired by Piet Mondrian. Uses recursive subdivision, randomized geometry, and color rules to generate unique abstract compositions in the Mondrian style. Supports both classic rectangular compositions and complex variants incorporating circular shapes. Demonstrates algorithmic art generation, Java graphics programming, and object-oriented design.

### Spam Classifier
[Repository Link](https://github.com/AmberErinLi/spam-classifier)  
Java-based classification tree (decision tree) that predicts whether a message is Spam or Ham based on text features. Demonstrates foundations of machine learning, including training, prediction, evaluation, and model serialization — all implemented from scratch without ML libraries.
